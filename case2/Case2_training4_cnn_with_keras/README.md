# CASE2 Cnn-with-keras. 
This assignment case is to build Convolutional Neural Network with keras

This case we take images classes, train a model with keras+tensorflow and then predict a new image with our "intelligent" model.

To have this notebook work you will need to:

- Put the notebook and training images in a separate folder

Below outline the standard import and installation settings for openCV and tensorflow, to get things working :P

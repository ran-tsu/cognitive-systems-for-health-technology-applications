#After importing the library, you read the dataset using function read_csv(). This is how the code looks like till this stage:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as plt
%matplotlib inline

df = pd.read_csv("/home/kunal/Downloads/Loan_Prediction/train.csv") #Reading the dataset in a dataframe using Pandas


#Once you have read the dataset, you can have a look at few top rows by using the function head()
df.head(10)


#Next, you can look at summary of numerical fields by using describe() function
df.describe()


#Lets start by plotting the histogram of ApplicantIncome using the following commands:
df['ApplicantIncome'].hist(bins=50)


#Next, we look at box plots to understand the distributions. Box plot for fare can be plotted by:
df.boxplot(column='ApplicantIncome')
# or
df.boxplot(column='ApplicantIncome', by = 'Education')


#Now, Letâ€™s look at the histogram and boxplot of LoanAmount using the following command:
df['LoanAmount'].hist(bins=50)


#Now we will look at the steps required to generate a similar insight using Python. Please refer to this article for getting a hang of the different data manipulation techniques in Pandas.
temp1 = df['Credit_History'].value_counts(ascending=True)
temp2 = df.pivot_table(values='Loan_Status',index=['Credit_History'],aggfunc=lambda x: x.map({'Y':1,'N':0}).mean())
print ('Frequency Table for Credit History:') 
print (temp1)

print ('\nProbility of getting loan for each Credit History class:')
print (temp2)
